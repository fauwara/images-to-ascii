so i thought it be would really cool if I could make an applicatiion which converts images into ascii charectors like this.

The application still does not give the best possible result for every image out there, it works better wiith simpler images.

## The Tech Stuff if your intrested in it.

### Tech Stack Used
    * Python
        * Numpy
        * Pillow

### TODO
    - [x] Atleast get it to work.
    - [ ] Get your lazy ass to upload it on github ffs.
    - [ ] Make it work for all Images.
    - [ ] Make code clean.
    - [ ] Make a website for it so that everyone can use it.
    - [ ] Make coloured ascii filter. ( basically emojis instead of ascii keys. )

### Lookin to contribute
    I dont think you wanna at the momment the code is a huge mess even I have a hard time figuring out why this code is even written this way.
    Maybe once i clean up the code I'll update this part.
