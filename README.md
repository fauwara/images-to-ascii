# ASCIIMAGES 

> A python application that converts images into ASCII styled texts. 

## The Idea
So I was chilling on youtube and I found this cool Saitamas ok Ascii thingy.  
![Saitama: OK](https://github.com/fauwara/images-to-ascii/blob/master/images/saitama-ok-ascii.png?raw=true)  
so I thought it would be cool if I could make an application that converts images into ASCII characters like this.

The application still does not give the best possible result for every image out there, it works better with simpler images.

## The Tech Stuff if your intrested in it.

### Tech Stack Used
    * Python
        * Numpy
        * Pillow

### TODO
    - [x] Atleast get it to work.
    - [ ] Get your lazy ass to upload it on github ffs.
    - [ ] Make it work for all Images.
    - [ ] Make code clean.
    - [ ] Make a website for it so that everyone can use it.
    - [ ] Make coloured ascii filter. ( basically emojis instead of ascii keys. )

### Lookin to contribute
I don't think you wanna. At the moment the code is a huge mess, even I have a hard time figuring out why this code is even written this way.
Maybe once I clean up the code I'll update this part.
